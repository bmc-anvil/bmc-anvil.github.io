My name is John Xavier, a developer and a tech enthusiast.<br>
I am not an engineer, just another self taught dev playing with a bit of this and
that technology.

## Some bullet facts

I do work as back-end software developer, either contracting or perm jobs.

I mostly do back-end for business apps in Java for a living, but sometimes I use JS/TS or python, mostly for old lambdas or for some
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) if the shop has those skills. Devops is also part of my trade, trying to
get better at it thou.

I have other projects that I will list accordingly when I have them a bit more advanced. Maybe the most fun is a music player in `C++`
and `Qt` for `Linux`. Yes! `C++` still exists! woah! I know.. I know... Ru(_piiiiip_)t...

I did some time with `C#` / `Golang` but it did not stick, they are ok... who knows... maybe in the future we say hello again.

Over the years I transitioned to software architecture on top of hands-on coding. It's fun..., as long as it's a beginning for getting to
code something cool. I do like to see a sketch turn into something _"real"_.

I try not to stick with any tech in particular. If on the job, I adopt what the shop requires. If for myself, I usually benchmark or explore
solutions and ideas, and change or adapt with new information. I did not use to like `TypeScript` much, and then ended up building a whole
infrastructure with it and with [pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) after evaluating other choices.<br>
Infrastructure_AC with Java or Go right? ha! right...

## Answers to those question that were not asked

I started with gnu-linux around '93, and became a full time gnu-linux user around '96 maybe.

I jump distros from time to time, used to be an [OpenSuSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) user now I'm on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) for
sometime now.

I started programming professionally around 2014, thou my first program was on
a [commodore 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) circa '85. Was mostly copying some basic from the manual. Yes sir! Computers
came with a manual back then. The thrill!

## Reach out

As social goes, I only have `linkedin` and `github`, so if you want to drop a line, it will have to be over those momentarily.
