Bare Metal Code's Anvil is a project management tool as many others, with a twist...

This site is not the application site itself, but the "companion" site for the app. A technical set of notes if you will.

The original purpose back in the day, was to build a showcase app, eventually that demo evolved into a proper full featured application.<br>
If you want to learn more about the beginnings, check the links to the left.


As with the original app, this one too will follow the showcase approach in documentation concerns. I'll do my best to publish
companion notes for each module and feature in the application.

The goal of this companion site is to track decisions and demonstrate the technologies that make app a working application.

I contains notes on:

- high level architecture that makes the app turn as a whole
- module level architecture that determines the approach taken for each service
- design approach taken in particular for each service
- bibliography and links in which I based some (or many) decisions
- why some compromises where made instead of following sometimes a more traditional approach
